        <h2> <u> Quick Introduction:</u> 
            <br> <br>
            <p>I am a software developer interested in front-end development. </p>
        
            <p>I graduated from the University of Bristol in Electrical and Electronics 
            Engineering in July 2018. In September 2018, I  joined the Santander Technology graduate scheme and
        began working on Front-end Angular development, along with unit and E2E testing. </p>
        
        <p>This project is to showcase and consolidate the knowledge and skills that I gained
        from my first rotation, during the scheme.</p>
